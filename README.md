Many of you know the classing game typeracer. I want to use what I learn from iOS and Swift to create my own app for typing test. 

The end product will essentially consist of three different levels:
(i) easy
(ii) medium
(iii) hard

Speed and Accuracy while typing will both be included when determining your score.

I will update this app with more features as I learn more and in stages as mentioned below:

Stage 1:
Basic Label, Text Field, Timer and Display Label

Stage 2:
Update Display Label with sample text to copy

Stage 2b:
Try to see what differentiates an easy, medium and hard application

Stage 3:
Implement different modes and transitions between those

Stage 4:
UI/UX features for app

Stage 5:
Find test users for application
